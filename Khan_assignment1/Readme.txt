This program was done indiviudally by Danyal Khan

Compiling commands: There is a shell script that within the Khan_assignment1 directory can be run and executed to run the driver program. The shell script name is: LinkedListDriver.sh
and can be run by ./LinkedListDriver.sh when within the Khan_assingment1 directory.
* However the compiling commands listed in the shell scirpt to compile the
LinkedlistDriver program are as follows:

*  javac -d bin src/assingment1/ItemType.java

*  javac -d bin -cp bin src/assingment1/NodeType.java

*  javac -d bin -cp bin src/assingment1/SortedLinkedList.java

*  javac -d bin -cp bin src/assingment1/LinkedListDriver.java

*  java -cp bin assingment1.LinkedListDriver src/assignment1/input.txt


Complexity of merge (SortedLinkedList method) : O(n)

Complexity of intersection (SortedLinkedList method) : O(n)

Complexity of deleteAlt (SortedLinkedList method) : O(n)
